# jsprim: utilities for primitive JavaScript types

This module provides miscellaneous facilities for working with strings,
numbers, dates, and objects and arrays of these basic types.


### deepCopy(obj)

Creates a deep copy of a primitive type, object, or array of primitive types.


### deepEqual(obj1, obj2)

Returns whether two objects are equal.


### isEmpty(obj)

Returns true if the given object has no properties and false otherwise.  This
is O(1) (unlike `Object.keys(obj).length === 0`, which is O(N)).


### forEachKey(obj, callback)

Like Array.forEach, but iterates properties of an object rather than elements
of an array.  Equivalent to:

    for (var key in obj)
            callback(key, obj[key]);


### flattenObject(obj, depth)

Flattens an object up to a given level of nesting, returning an array of arrays
of length "depth + 1", where the first "depth" elements correspond to flattened
columns and the last element contains the remaining object .  For example:

    flattenObject({
        'I': {
